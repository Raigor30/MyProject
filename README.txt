Title: 
"Design and Implementation of a Low-Power Embedded System for Real-Time Environmental Monitoring"

Description:
The thesis aims to investigate and implement improvements in how a multi-core processor interacts
with memory and cache, with the end goal of boosting the overall computational performance of the system. 
This could involve strategies to reduce memory access latency, optimize cache usage, and enhance the parallel
processing capabilities of multi-core architectures.




MyProject Information:
The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly stepping through the list of numbers to be sorted, 
comparing each pair of adjacent items, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass 
through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which means the list is sorted.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps:

* Start from the beginning of the list.
* Compare each pair of adjacent numbers.
* If a pair is in the wrong order (the left one is greater than the right one), swap them.
* Continue this process from the beginning to the end of the list.
* Repeat these steps until no more swaps are needed.

The largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position in each pass. The process is 
repeated until the entire list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements
"bubble" to the top of the list.
